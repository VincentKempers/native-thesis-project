# NativeScript-Vue Application

This is an native application that will use an OCR to read out text and analyse the text to indetify difficult words based on your dutch language skill.
This application is to help the people who have difficulties reading and writing on the dutch standard level.
It will help them to read official documents and official forms which use difficult language (sometimes on purpose).
